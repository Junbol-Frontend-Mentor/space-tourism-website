## My process

### ðŸ›  Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup ðŸ§¾
- ChakraUI & Flexbox ðŸŽ¨
- Mobile-first workflow ðŸ“±
- GIT/GitHub ðŸ§¾ðŸŒŽ
- PowerShell (CLI) ðŸ§¾
- Typescript & Javascript ðŸ¤–
- React with Vite ðŸ¤–
- Node & NPM
- Emotion ðŸ¤ª
- Vitest

### What I learned

- Working with the Typescript for the first time was a challenge. But gradually I am making progress.

- GitHub pages and React Router are not really good friends.So, the solution for this was the use of HashRouter: import { HashRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom'; // Import HashRouter

- First experience testing React and Typescript with Vitest = a nightmare ðŸ¤£

- I always want to a bit of excitement/entertainment to my projects so this time I raised my own bar and added 3d animation to the satellites: programming and 3d modeling and animations is what I feel really happy working with.

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying Typescript since that is we are heading to.
