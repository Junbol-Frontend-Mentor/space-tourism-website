## My process

- BEM (Block.Element.Modifier)ðŸ§¾
- Mobile-first workflow ðŸ“±
- GIT/GitHub ðŸ§¾ðŸŒŽ

### What I learned

- Working with the Grid was a challenge. But gradually I am making progress. A good working grid is a combination of grid and flexbox settings.

- You need to grid area you containers not the items inside your containers.

```



```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive SCSS specially with Grid + Flexbox and CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
